      <p>This policy is effective as of 3 July 2022 and was last updated on 16 January 2023.</p>

      <p>
        Please read this agreement carefully before accessing or using our services. By accessing or using any part of
        our services, you agree to become bound by the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you do not agree to
        all the terms and conditions of this agreement, then you may not access or use any of our services. If these
        terms and conditions are considered an offer by Moon Pixels, acceptance is expressly limited to these terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using some of our services requires an account. You agree to provide us with complete and accurate information
        when you register for an account. You will be solely responsible and liable for any activity that occurs under
        your user account and keeping your password secure.
      </p>

      <h2>Content Posted on Other Websites</h2>

      <p>
        We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available
        through the websites and webpages to which Moon Pixels links, and that link to Moon Pixels. Moon Pixels does not
        have any control over those websites and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to
        another website, Moon Pixels does not represent or imply that it endorses such a website. You are responsible
        for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan
        horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Moon Pixels disclaims any responsibility for any harm
        resulting from your use of non-Moon Pixels websites and webpages.
      </p>

      <h2>Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy</h2>

      <p>
        As Moon Pixels asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property
        rights of others. If you believe that material located on or linked to by Moon Pixels violates your copyright,
        you are encouraged to notify Moon Pixels by email at
        <a href="mailto:hello@moonpixels.co.uk">hello@moonpixels.co.uk.</a>
        Moon Pixels will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing
        material or disabling all links to the infringing material. Moon Pixels will terminate a visitor’s access to and
        use of the Website if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of
        the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Moon Pixels or others.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

      <p>
        This agreement does not transfer from Moon Pixels to you. Any Moon Pixels or third party intellectual property,
        and all rights, titles, and interests in such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with Moon
        Pixels. All trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with Moon Pixels or our services,
        are trademarks or registered trademarks of Moon Pixels. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used
        in connection with our services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of our Services grants
        you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Moon Pixels or third-party trademarks.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>

      <p>
        We are constantly updating our services, and that means sometimes we have to change the legal terms under which
        our services are offered. If we make changes that are material, we will let you know by making an announcement
        on one of our websites, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The
        notice will designate a reasonable time period after which the new terms will take effect. If you disagree with
        our changes, then you should stop using our services within the designated notice period. Your continued use of
        our services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be
        governed by the terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place when the dispute
        arose.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>

      <p>
        Moon Pixels may terminate your access to all or any part of our services at any time, with or without cause,
        with or without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this agreement or your Moon Pixels
        account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our services. All provisions of this Agreement which
        by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
        provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.
      </p>

      <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

      <p>
        Some of our services are billed on a subscription basis (the "Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance
        on a recurring and periodic basis (such as monthly or yearly, depending on the type of subscription plan you
        select when purchasing a Subscription). Billing cycles are set on a per Subscription basis.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of each billing cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions
        unless you cancel it or Moon Pixels cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your
        online account management page or by contacting our customer support team via
        <a href="mailto:hello@moonpixels.co.uk">hello@moonpixels.co.uk.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You
        shall provide Moon Pixels and our payment providors with accurate and complete billing information including
        full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting
        such payment information, you automatically authorize Moon Pixels to charge all Subscription fees incurred
        through your account to any such payment instruments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Moon Pixels will issue an electronic invoice indicating
        that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the
        billing period as indicated on the invoice.
      </p>

      <h2>Refunds</h2>

      <p>
        We do not offer refunds for any of our services, except if required by law. If you have any issues with our
        services, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:hello@moonpixels.co.uk">hello@moonpixels.co.uk.</a>
      </p>

        consequential damages; (ii) the cost of procurement for substitute products or services; (iii) for interruption
        of use or loss or corruption of data; or (iv) for any amounts that exceed the fees paid by you to Moon Pixels
        under this agreement during the twelve (12) month period before the cause of action. Moon Pixels shall have no
        liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond their reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply
        to the extent prohibited by applicable law.
      </p>
